### New Task Instructions for the Assistant

**Purpose**
- Given two inputs, `market_scenario` and `debate_context`, produce a math-heavy, probabilistic, risk-adjusted asset-allocation analysis with explicit, transparent formulas and a defensible decision rule. The analysis should be suitable for decision-making by a portfolio or strategy team that values Bayesian reasoning, state-pricing concepts, and Kelly-criterion sizing under drawdown constraints.

**Inputs**
- `market_scenario`: A descriptive narrative of the macro/micro environment (e.g., global uncertainty, supply chain disruptions, sector-specific dynamics).
- `debate_context`: Optional context that may include objectives, constraints, metrics, risk tolerances, or prior beliefs to be incorporated into the analysis.

**Output**
- A single field named `response` that contains a structured, numerically-grounded analysis. Do not reveal hidden chain-of-thought or step-by-step internal reasoning. Provide clear results, formulas, and decision rules, plus a compact numerical example and a sensitivity study.

**Required content and structure (in the response)**

**1) Assumptions and inputs** (transparent, explicit)
- **State-risk framework**: denote a finite set of macro states S = {base, optimistic, pessimistic} (or more granular if you prefer). Assign prior probabilities p_s to each state; allow updating via Bayesian reasoning as new data arrives.
- **Risk-free reference**: r_f (per-period). If not provided, state a default reasonable range and show results with it.
- **Sector set**: define the sectors to analyze (for real-estate scenario: Industrial/Logistics, Multifamily, Office, Retail). If other sectors are relevant to the market_scenario, include them as needed.
- **Metrics to leverage** (when available): volatility (σ), sector_return_ytd, pe_ratio, and any other supplied indicators. State how these feed priors or sanity checks.
- **State-prices**: introduce q_s (state-price densities) or provide an equivalent discounted-probability form for cash-flow valuation under each state.

**2) Probabilistic framework and priors**
- **Priors and updating rule**: Specify priors for key risk factors (e.g., geopolitical risk, supply-chain disruption probability, currency risk) as p_s and/or as sector-specific nuisance parameters. Describe how you would update posteriors with new data via Bayes' rule:
  - Posterior p_s' ∝ Likelihood(data | s) × Prior(p_s)
- **Maximum-entropy note**: When priors are weakly informed, justify using a maximum-entropy prior over states given constraints from market-implied data or the debate_context.

**3) Scenario probabilities and cash-flow modeling**
- **Scenario probabilities**: Provide baseline probabilities p_base, p_optimistic, p_pessimistic and explain how you would adjust them in light of debate_context or new data.
- **Cash-flow under each state**: For each sector i and state s, define CF_i,s as the cash flow (or revenue/EA proxy) per unit of capital or per share/contract unit under state s.
- **Discounting / pricing under state-prices**: Compute the state-price-weighted expected cash flow:
  - E_i = Σ_s q_s CF_i,s where q_s are state prices (normalized so Σ_s q_s = 1 if you work with unit prices).
- **Expected return and risk**:
  - Expected cash flow (per unit of capital): E_i
  - Expected excess return over risk-free: e_i = E_i - r_f
  - Risk measure (distributional variance): σ_i^2 = Σ_s q_s (CF_i,s - E_i)^2
  - Optional robust/alternative risk metric: compute a concordant equivalent or use a simple variance proxy if you only have a few states.

**4) Edge, Kelly sizing, and drawdown constraints**
- **Edge and volatility inputs**:
  - Use e_i as the edge for sector i.
  - Use σ_i as the effective per-sector volatility derived from the state-distribution (σ_i^2 = Var[CF_i,s] under state-prices).
  - If a market-implied volatility is provided (e.g., σ = 55.8%), document how you adapt it to per-sector σ_i (e.g., cap, share of total portfolio volatility, or a weighted average).
- **Kelly allocation rule with cap**:
  - Compute the Kelly fraction for sector i: K_i = e_i / σ_i^2
  - Enforce a drawdown/cap constraint: K_i is limited to a maximum cap K_cap (default e.g., 0.50 or as specified in debate_context). Final per-sector weight: w_i = min(K_i, K_cap)
  - Normalize to budget B (or to sum to 1 if you're allocating fractions): If Σ_i w_i > 0, set w_i' = w_i / Σ_j w_j; else, allocate all to cash or default to a baseline conservative allocation.
- **Additional risk controls**:
  - If desired, incorporate a minimum cash/ark asset buffer, or a minimum/maximum exposure per sector.
  - Optional addition: compute portfolio-level expected return E_p = Σ_i w_i' E_i and portfolio variance or a simple risk metric using a correlation assumption if provided.

**5) Output deliverables** (for each sector)
- For each sector i, provide:
  - E_i (state-price–weighted expected cash flow per unit of capital)
  - σ_i (per-state-variance proxy)
  - e_i (excess return)
  - K_i (raw Kelly fraction)
  - w_i (pre-cap Kelly weight, then w_i' after cap and normalization)
  - Final allocation weight w_i' (as a fraction of total capital)
  - Optional: projected cash-flow-based return series and sensitivity to small parameter changes

**6) Portfolio-level results and interpretation**
- Provide:
  - Portfolio expected cash flow E_p and portfolio expected excess return e_p
  - Portfolio risk proxy (σ_p) derived from sector σ_i and any included correlation assumptions (state-based or a simple aggregate)
  - Sensitivity analysis: show how allocations w_i' change with a ±1–5 percentage-point shift in key inputs (e.g., p_base, σ_i, e_i, or K_cap)
  - Scenario-weighted scenario table: list p_s, CF_i,s for each sector, and contributions to portfolio metrics
- Notes on interpretations and caveats:
  - Emphasize that outputs are probabilistic and contingent on the correctness of priors, state prices, and the assumption that the future behaves in a way captured by the three-state model.
  - Clarify that this framework supports decision rules, not guarantees; provide suggested trigger points for rebalancing.

**7) Output style and restrictions**
- Do not reveal internal chain-of-thought. Present results in a clear, decision-focused format with explicit formulas and a compact numerical example.
- Use precise mathematical notation, but accompany with plain-language explanations for each formula.
- Include a compact numerical example illustrating how to compute K_i, w_i', and a small sensitivity study.
- If debate_context provides constraints or preferences (e.g., "avoid over 30% in Office," "prioritize logistics due to nearshoring"), enforce those as hard constraints or soften with explicit penalties or alternative allocations.

**8) Example structure you may follow** (do not copy verbatim; adapt to inputs)
- Executive summary: key takeaways and recommended portfolio posture
- Inputs and priors: r_f, σ_base, sector-specific σ_i, priors for p_s, K_cap
- State-space and scenario probabilities: p_base, p_optimistic, p_pessimistic
- Sector analyses: for i in {Industrial/Logistics, Multifamily, Office, Retail}
  - CF_i,s and E_i, e_i, σ_i, K_i, w_i, w_i'
- Portfolio results: E_p, e_p, σ_p, and allocations
- Sensitivity analysis: effects of ±Δ in key inputs
- Appendices: explicit formulas and a compact numerical worked example (with made-up numbers for illustration if needed)

**9) Quality and consistency checks**
- Ensure the output is internally consistent: probabilities sum to 1, weights sum to 1 (after normalization), units are consistent across sectors, and formulas align with the stated definitions.
- If any required input is missing (e.g., r_f or a K_cap), clearly specify a default and show results under that default.
- Where numbers are shown, label them clearly (e.g., E_i, σ_i^2, K_i, w_i') and provide a short interpretation for non-technical readers.

By adhering to these guidelines, the assistant will produce a rigorous, probabilistic, and decision-ready analysis that integrates Bayesian thinking, state-pricing concepts, and risk-aware capital allocation using the Kelly framework with explicit drawdown controls.
