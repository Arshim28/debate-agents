# Sectoral Assessment Report: Indian IT/Technology Sector

## Executive Summary
The Indian IT/Technology sector is experiencing profound polarization as it navigates a complex transition from legacy services to AI-driven digital transformation. Recent data reveals a bifurcated landscape where mid-cap firms demonstrate robust growth through AI-enabled solutions and strategic M&A, while Tier-1 giants face margin pressures and slower revenue growth. Simultaneously, structural tailwinds in data center infrastructure and sovereign AI initiatives are creating new growth vectors independent of traditional IT services. The sector faces significant regulatory headwinds from U.S. visa policies and proposed legislation, but domestic policy initiatives and data center expansion are mitigating these pressures. Current trends indicate a fundamental shift in competitive dynamics rather than sector-wide stagnation, with AI adoption creating both disruption and opportunity across different segments.

## Core Thesis Confrontation

### Growth Believer's Optimistic Case
The Growth Believer perspective emphasizes structural tailwinds driving sector resilience. Key arguments include:
- **AI as productivity multiplier**: Infosys reported 55% of its $3.8B TCV in Q1 FY26 came from AI-led transformations, with AI agents delivering 5-15% productivity gains. Tech Mahindra expanded EBIT margins +56 bps QoQ through "Project Fortius" offshoring and AI implementation.
- **Mid-cap momentum**: Coforge delivered +9.6% QoQ USD revenue growth and +53.6% YoY, while Persistent Systems achieved +2.8% QoQ and +21.8% YoY growth. These firms are leveraging AI platforms (Forge-X, AI training data services) to capture market share.
- **Data center expansion**: India's colocation capacity is projected to quintuple from 1.7 GW to 8 GW by 2030, requiring $63B in combined facility and server capex. S&P Global estimates India will become the second-largest data center electricity market in Asia-Pacific within two years.
- **Policy tailwinds**: The IndiaAI Mission awarded 34,371 GPUs by mid-2025, with state-level policies like Maharashtra's AVGC-XR Policy (₹3,268 crore outlay) and Odisha's IT Policy creating domestic talent and compute infrastructure.

### Cynic's Risk Assessment
The Cynic perspective highlights structural challenges and deflationary pressures:
- **Revenue deflation**: AI is projected to carve out ~20% of existing IT services revenues by FY30, particularly in high-margin segments like application management and BPO. Global IT services CAGR is throttling to 1.5-3% (CY24-29), dragging India's IT coverage to 3.8% CAGR (FY25-28).
- **Regulatory headwinds**: U.S. H-1B visa fee hike ($100,000 one-time fee) triggered a ~3% Nifty IT drop on September 22, 2025. Proposed HIRE Act could impose ~25% tax on foreign services payments, threatening onsite delivery models.
- **Talent cost pressures**: Attrition spiked +160 bps QoQ to 18.2% at Happiest Minds and +250 bps at Tech Mahindra, inflating talent acquisition costs by 10-15% YoY despite flat Tier-1 headcount growth (TCS +0.8% YoY, Infosys +0.1%).
- **Client spending retrenchment**: Enterprises are optimizing existing budgets rather than greenlighting new IT spend, with retail, auto, and consumer verticals showing flat-to-negative QoQ growth.

### Dialectical Resolution
The debate reveals fundamental convergence on AI's disruptive impact but divergence on its net effect. Both sides agree that:
- AI adoption is accelerating across the sector (97% of key accounts adopting AI per Cognizant's Q2 CY25)
- BFSI verticals remain the strongest growth driver (+5-7% YoY across major players)
- Tier-1 and mid-cap performance is diverging significantly

However, they fundamentally disagree on whether AI creates net value:
- Growth Believers view AI as a productivity multiplier that enables margin defense and new revenue streams (e.g., AI training data services)
- Cynics see AI as a deflationary force that erodes traditional revenue pools while creating new competitive threats from U.S. AI platforms

The sector is not experiencing uniform stagnation but rather a Darwinian reallocation where agile players capture value from AI integration while legacy models face pressure. The data center infrastructure boom represents a structural growth vector largely decoupled from traditional IT services dynamics.
