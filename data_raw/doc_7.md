## Nifty IT Index: Movement & Market Sentiment (15-22 Sept 2025)

| Metric                                   | Value / Change                                                                                 | Notes                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Drop on 22 Sept**                      | \~ **3%** fall in Nifty IT index                                                               | Following U.S. announcement of a hike in H-1B visa fees. ([Reuters][1])           |
| **Individual stocks (major IT players)** | Declines of 2-5% for TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra etc.                         | Persistent Systems saw one of the larger losses (\~4%) on 22 Sept. ([Reuters][1]) |
| **Sensex / Nifty-50 impact**             | Sensex down \~0.5-0.6% (≈ 300-466 points), Nifty-50 down \~0.5% (\~124-125 points) on 22 Sept. | Drag primarily from IT sector. ([Moneycontrol][2])                                |
| **Year-to-date (YTD)**                   | Nifty IT index down \~15.6%; contrast with Nifty 50 being up \~7.1% YTD                        | Suggests broader underperformance of IT versus general market. ([Reuters][1])     |

Thus, last week’s sharpest move was triggered by U.S. policy change (visa fee hike), pushing down valuations and raising concern over margins, onsite deliveries etc.

## Key Policy / Regulatory & International Developments

These events are likely to affect India’s IT sector going forward.

1. **U.S. H-1B Visa Fee Hike (announced \~ 19-22 Sept 2025)**

   * A one-time fee of **US\$100,000** has been imposed on new H-1B visa applications. ([Reuters][3])
   * Concern: This raises cost of deploying skilled workers onsite in the U.S., affecting Indian IT companies which rely heavily on onsite models. ([South China Morning Post][4])
   * Market reaction: Investor sentiment negative; stocks fell; Nifty IT lost \~3%. ([Reuters][5])

2. **HIRE Act (proposed U.S. legislation)**

   * The *Halting International Relocation of Employment (HIRE) Act 2025* is under discussion. Proposed to impose \~25% tax on payments made to foreign workers for services consumed in the U.S., plus remove certain tax deductibility. ([Financial Times][6])
   * Could materially affect business models of Indian firms exporting services, or with global capability centres. ([Financial Times][6])

3. **Domestic Policy: Maharashtra AVGC-XR Policy 2025**

   * State government (Maharashtra) approved policy for AVGC-XR (Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, XR) on \~ **17-18 Sept**, with investment outlay \~ **₹3,268 crore**. ([The Times of India][7])
   * Aims: Attract \~₹50,000 crore private investment, generate \~200,000 (2 lakh) jobs over long term. 24×7 operations, infrastructure, skill development etc. ([The Times of India][8])

4. **State Policy in Odisha**

   * Odisha Cabinet approved **Electronics Component Manufacturing (OECM) Policy 2025** and **IT Policy 2025**. ([The Times of India][9])
   * Key features: Increased capital subsidy (25-30%, +40% for animation), no upper limit on investment cost for subsidies, benefits for skill development, patent registration, creation of centre(s) of excellence. Target: \~1 million jobs. ([The Times of India][9])

5. **Industry Stakeholder Response / Strategic Shifts**

   * Indian IT industry calling for a **single-window clearance system** for GCCs, startups, research organisations — partly in response to U.S. visa policy changes increasing operational friction. ([The Economic Times][10])
   * Companies likely to shift more work offshore, invest in automation/AI to reduce dependency on onsite labour. ([South China Morning Post][4])

## Implications & Risks

* **Margin Pressure**: Higher costs of visas & possibly taxes under proposed U.S. legislation will erode margins especially for companies with significant onsite presence.
* **Business Model Rethink**: Shift from onsite to offshore delivery, more hiring of local U.S. employees, or pushing up the value chain (e.g. AI, automation).
* **Talent Mobility / Workforce Strategy**: Constraints on cross-border labour could force firms to restructure how they deploy staff globally.
* **Policy Incentives Domestically**: State policies like Maharashtra and Odisha will help build alternate capacity (AVGC-XR, component manufacturing, etc.) and might shift some investment and job creation domestic.
* **Investor Sentiment**: Negative events like U.S. visa fee changes tend to trigger stock price falls; given IT is underperforming YTD, confidence is fragile.
