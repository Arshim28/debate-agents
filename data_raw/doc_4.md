Strap in—because this is the battlefield map where quarterly performance, AI-led transformations, and margin skirmishes converge. Here’s the surgical breakdown:

---

### First-Order Insights (Immediate Truths)

* **Mixed Topline**: Revenues were modest YoY, but sequentially muted due to delayed ramp-ups and cautious discretionary spending—**Infosys led Tier-1 with +4.5% QoQ USD growth**, TCS dipped (–0.6%), Wipro (–1.6%), HCLT barely flat (+0.3%).
* **Tier-2 Outperformance**: Coforge posted a blowout **+9.6% QoQ USD growth** and 53.6% YoY growth; Persistent +2.8% QoQ, +21.8% YoY; Happiest Minds steady with +1% QoQ.
* **Margins Diverged**: TechM expanded EBIT margin +56 bps QoQ to 11.1%, while HCLT slipped –171 bps to 16.3%. Infosys edged down –13 bps to 20.8%. Tier-2 margins held steady—Persistent at 15.5%, Coforge 13.2%.
* **PAT Winners**: TCS PAT rose 4.4% QoQ; Persistent PAT jumped 7.4% QoQ; Happiest Minds surged 68% QoQ despite attrition spiking to 18.2%.
* **Valuation Stance**: Centrum keeps TCS, Infosys, LTIM, Coforge, Persistent as **BUYs**, TechM and HCLT as **ADDs**, Wipro, LTTS, Mphasis as **REDUCE**, Happiest Minds as **ADD**.

### Second-Order Insights (Ripple Effects)

* **AI-Led Deals = Stabilizer**: Even as discretionary IT spend weakens, **AI-driven transformations and vendor consolidation** are filling order books. Infosys (\$3.8B TCV, 55% net new) and Mphasis (68% of TCV AI-led) illustrate this pivot.
* **Margin Resilience via AI**: Productivity gains (Infosys’ AI agents 5–15%, HCLT’s AIForce, Coforge’s Forge-X) are cushioning EBIT erosion, creating **self-funded margin defense** mechanisms.
* **Sector Divergence**: BFSI is the warhorse—supporting growth across Infosys, Coforge, Persistent. Auto, retail, consumer remain fragile under tariff/geopolitical weight. Tech & healthcare display resilience.
* **Talent Pyramid Reset**: Headcount moves are surgical—flat or muted in Tier-1 (TCS +0.8%, Infosys +0.1%), but Coforge (+28.5% YoY) and Persistent (+7.7%) ramping sharply. Attrition ticked up, especially at TechM (+250 bps QoQ) and Happiest Minds (+160 bps QoQ).

### Counter-Intuitive Insights (Hidden Alpha)

* **Winners Are Mid-Caps, Not Giants**: While Jefferies screams structural slowdown, Centrum shows **Tier-2 firms (Coforge, Persistent, Happiest Minds)** as growth engines—outpacing Tier-1 peers despite macro drag. Market underestimates their ability to weaponize AI IP.
* **AI Cannibalization Myth**: Infosys and TCS confirm no major cannibalization—AI-led productivity is instead **winning consolidation deals**. The “AI cuts revenues” thesis is overstated in near-term execution.
* **Capex as Signal**: Coforge’s \$58M AI datacenter buildout in Q1 is contrarian—while peers trim discretionary spend, Coforge doubles down on infra-led delivery, effectively creating **operator-level leverage** on infra trends.
* **Margins Can Expand Despite Slowing Growth**: TechM’s +56 bps QoQ margin expansion amidst topline weakness proves that **offshoring + AI productivity + subcontracting control** can outmuscle macro softness.

Given the current situation as of **August 2025**, the IT services battlefield is fractured: Tier-1s drag under macro gravity, but Tier-2s sprint ahead with AI-led execution. The narrative isn’t broad-based stagnation—it’s **polarization between scale-anchored laggards and agile AI-native climbers**.
