Strap in—because the Kotak July 31, 2025 sector note is the counterweight to the Jefferies doomsday narrative. Instead of AI as a guillotine, this report positions it as a competitive blade—cutting margins for laggards but forging alpha for those who wield it smartly. Let’s dissect:

---

### First-Order Insights (Obvious but Critical)

* **Cognizant’s Rebound**: Cognizant (CTSH) clocked **7.2% c/c revenue growth**, beating guidance and peers, with two \$1B+ mega-deals in Q2CY25. Organic growth at 3.2% outpaced TCS and Infosys.
* **Sector View: Neutral**: Kotak flags heightened **competitive intensity** as CTSH claws back wallet share in healthcare and financial services—once bastions of Indian IT.
* **AI Adoption Depth**: 97% of key CTSH accounts are already adopting AI, with **30% of code AI-generated** in 2QCY25. CTSH is monetizing “AI training data services” across the G-2000, widening beyond tech clients.
* **Valuation Snapshot**: Kotak’s valuation table pegs Infosys, TCS, TechM as **BUYs**, HCLT, LTIM, Mphasis as **REDUCE**, and Wipro as **SELL**.
* **Mid-cap Differentiation**: Coforge, Hexaware, Persistent flagged as high-growth mid-caps, albeit with volatility, while KPIT, Tata Elxsi see derating risks.

### Second-Order Insights (Ripple Effects)

* **Mega-Deal Renaissance**: CTSH’s resurgence in mega-deals (more signed in CY25 than India’s top three combined) alters the competitive chessboard. Indian majors must now fight on **cost-takeout + AI-integration** simultaneously.
* **Healthcare Crosscurrents**: Medicaid cuts and tariff risks dent discretionary spend, yet payers are pushing for **offshoring + AI-led automation**—a recipe for those ready to front-load AI cost savings.
* **Attrition Cycle Turning**: Voluntary attrition stabilizing at \~14–16% (down from 30% in 2022) relieves margin drag, but Kotak warns wage hikes and deal ramp-up costs in 2H25 will limit expansion.
* **Deal Visibility vs Discretionary Drought**: TCV bookings up 6% YoY, but discretionary spends remain muted. The implication: **revenue pipelines depend disproportionately on mega-deals, not broad-based demand**.

### Counter-Intuitive Insights (Alpha Pockets)

* **CTSH as Sector Barometer**: Jefferies casts AI as a deflationary axe; Kotak shows CTSH weaponizing it for **market share gains**. If this playbook holds, Indian IT is not facing secular decline, but **Darwinian reallocation**—the agile win, the rigid bleed.
* **Consulting Isn’t the Weak Link**: With Kotak’s emphasis on AI-led innovation programs and Jefferies warning of margin compression, consulting emerges paradoxically as a **defensive moat**, not a drag.
* **Mid-caps as Shock Absorbers**: In a slow-growth world, mid-caps (Coforge, Hexaware, Persistent) could outperform by being nimble in AI service-line pivots. Market has not fully priced their capacity to outrun deflationary drag.
* **AI Training Data Services = New BPO**: The quiet bombshell—10k CTSH employees training AI models. This signals a **new BPO revenue vertical** that Indian IT can scale, effectively replacing some lost headcount-driven revenue pools.

Given the situation as of **July 31, 2025**, the India IT narrative is no longer monolithic. Jefferies screams stagnation; Kotak reveals selective resurgence. The battlefield has shifted from topline growth to **AI-enabled market share wars**, where winners are defined not by who avoids deflation, but by who **monetizes AI faster than peers**.
