Strap in—because this September 11, 2025 intelligence is a thunderclap for India’s IT engine. AI isn’t just “transformative”; it’s actively derailing the sector’s traditional growth flywheel. Here’s the autopsy, across layers:

---

### First-Order Insights (Obvious but Critical)

* **Revenue Deflation**: AI is projected to carve out **\~20% of existing IT services revenues by FY30**, especially in high-margin segments like application management and BPO.
* **Growth Collapse**: Global IT services CAGR throttles down to **1.5–3% (CY24–29)**, dragging India’s IT coverage to a **3.8% CAGR (FY25–28)**—barely half the decade prior.
* **Margin Flatlining**: Aggregate EBIT margins freeze at \~20% through FY28 as deflation strikes higher-yield services while growth tilts toward lower-margin consulting & implementation.
* **Valuation Compression**: Indian IT trades at a **22% premium to Accenture vs historical 13% discount**. That gap screams derating risk if earnings miss expectations.
* **Stock Rankings**: Among large caps, **Infosys & HCLT least exposed**; **TechM & Wipro most vulnerable**. Mid-sized firms (Coforge, Hexaware, Mphasis) show higher growth but face sharper volatility.

### Second-Order Insights (Ripple Effects)

* **Client Behavior Reset**: Enterprises, having burned \$280B annually on tech from 2021–24, are in **ROI-retrench mode**—optimizing existing budgets instead of greenlighting new IT spend.
* **Tariff Headwinds**: US tariffs in 2026 add another choke point. Even with Fed cuts, firms will divert savings to margin defense, not discretionary IT spending.
* **Labor Model Stress**: AI flattens junior hiring funnels, worsening **employee pyramids**. This squeezes delivery leverage, especially for firms leaning on offshore, pyramid-heavy models.
* **Shift in Spend Mix**: Hardware and AI infra hog incremental budgets, while IT services’ share shrinks—meaning hyperscalers and hardware vendors siphon growth away from Indian IT.

### Counter-Intuitive Insights (Alpha Pockets)

* **Bigger Isn’t Safer**: While Infosys and HCLT look resilient, their sheer size caps upside. **Mid-caps with agility (Coforge, Hexaware)** could still rip double-digit earnings growth, if they pivot faster into AI advisory and modernization plays.
* **Revenue Deflation = Market Share Catalyst**: Productivity-led savings force clients to consolidate vendors. **Market share reallocation** favors firms that can prove ROI on AI integration, not those merely preserving legacy contracts.
* **Cloud First = Margin Backdoor**: AI-driven complexity in stacks (new inference layers between data & apps) raises integration demand. This complexity paradoxically **enhances IT services’ indispensability**, even as topline growth slows.
* **Consulting as an Unlikely Winner**: While consulting margins are thinner, it’s insulated from deep AI deflation (5–10% hit vs 20–35% in BPO/app services). This flips the script: **trust-heavy advisory may quietly emerge as the most defensible moat**.

Given the situation as of **September 2025**, the Indian IT story is no longer about topline expansion—it’s about **margin preservation, derating management, and AI-pivot speed**. Alpha extraction lies in:

* **Owning the mid-cap sprinters that convert AI disruption into growth.**
* **Avoiding the laggards (TechM/Wipro) shackled to deflationary revenue pools.**
* **Leaning into service-line arbitrage (consulting/AI modernization) rather than legacy BPO/AMS contracts.**
