Strap in—the **Antique Morning Presentation (July 7, 2025)** lays bare a battlefield where IT services crawl through a soft patch while select mid-caps ignite with velocity. Here’s the breakdown:

---

### First-Order Insights (Immediate Truths)

* **Sector softness persists**: Top six IT firms expected **–2.5% to +2% CC QoQ revenue**; mid-caps slightly stronger at **–2% to +6% CC QoQ**.
* **Guidance intact but muted**: Infosys sticking to 0–3% FY26E CC growth, HCLT 2–5%. Wipro guides –1% to +1% for 2QFY26.
* **Margins narrow**: Expected band –80 to +50 bps QoQ. TechM & LTIM showing expansion; HCLT pressured downwards.
* **Deal momentum steady, not explosive**: Large closures limited as clients cling to cost optimization, but pipeline healthy—delayed, not destroyed.
* **Rating shifts**: TechM cut to HOLD from BUY; most others stable with marginal TP revisions.

### Second-Order Insights (Ripple Effects)

* **Polarization emerging**: Tier-1s (Infosys, HCLT, Wipro) anchor the slowdown; Tier-2s like Coforge (+8.4% QoQ USD, +50% YoY) and Persistent (+4.8% QoQ USD, +20% YoY) sprint ahead.
* **AI/platform transformation**: Still a 2HFY26 story—early margin cushioning visible, but revenue acceleration contingent on macro easing.
* **BFSI as lifeline**: Continues to be the vertical holding up growth across Tier-1 and Tier-2; retail, manufacturing, and discretionary digital lag behind.
* **Selective margin defense**: TechM leveraging “Project Fortius” to push EBIT to 11% (+50 bps), LTIM also expanding +50 bps; Coforge widening EBIT +100 bps via integration savings.

### Counter-Intuitive Insights (Hidden Alpha)

* **The myth of broad slowdown**: While consensus screams “soft quarter,” the reality is **an hourglass-shaped field**—weight at the top (Tier-1 stagnation), but speed at the middle (Coforge, Persistent, Firstsource).
* **Cost obsession = delayed AI unlock**: Enterprises are slashing discretionary digital spend, but ironically this sets the stage for **vendor consolidation-led AI deals**—leaner supplier rosters with fatter contracts downstream.
* **Coforge’s inorganic bet**: +2.2% inorganic contribution signals they’re not waiting for macro winds—they’re **manufacturing growth via M\&A + infra ramp-ups**.
* **Margin paradox**: Despite flat topline, firms like TechM (+34% YoY PAT) are showing EBIT expansion through surgical offshoring and cost control—proof that **profit levers can fire independently of revenue levers**.

Given the current situation as of **July 2025**, the IT services arena isn’t collapsing—it’s **rebalancing**. The giants tread water; the mid-caps are quietly compounding. The market’s narrative of uniform softness misses the divergence: **alpha lies in those agile mid-tier firms leveraging AI, inorganic growth, and consolidation tailwinds**.
